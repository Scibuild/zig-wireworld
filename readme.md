# Zig Wireworld

A zig implementation of [Wireworld++](https://wpmedia.wolfram.com/uploads/sites/13/2018/07/27-1-2.pdf). Uses [prime31/zig-gamekit](https://github.com/prime31/zig-gamekit) as its game frame work. To use make sure to clone `zig-gamekit` into the root of the project, because submodules are evil.
